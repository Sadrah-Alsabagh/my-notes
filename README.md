## Introduction about **Sadrah Alsabagh**
I  completed an International Diploma in Software Engineering as well as a web development bootcamp. I also have knowledge in Basic DevOps tools from a 2-months training. I am excited about this class because I believe software testing is a crucial part of the development process and can help ensure that the end product is efficient, reliable and meets the end user's expectations.

## A good developer mindset 🌱.

1. The purpose of software can vary depending on its intended use and the needs of its users.
2. Programming is a way of reducing complexity to simplicity.
3. Consistency is critical for software development to help users learn and navigate the program more easily, prevent errors, and improve maintainability.
4. If you can't explain something in simple terms, you may not understand it well enough.
5. Creating software that is easy to understand and use can enhance its overall quality and value.


Understanding is the key difference between a *bad* developer and a *good* developer.😊👍

“Perfect is the enemy of good.”❤️
